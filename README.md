# Tick-Rate-Map-Maker
A software to help make tile maps for games like Tick-Rate

Thank you for visiting TRMM's repository! 
My name is Noah Perez and I created this program 
to provide myself a convenient way of making tile-maps.

--FUNCTION--
This program allows for tile-map creation at any size, and with any texture.
Note that the textures are ordered from 0 to 1, and "air"/empty tiles are
defaulted to a value of -1.

--DRAWING--
To draw a tile, first left-click your desired texture,
and then right-click (and drag) to draw a tile with the selected texture.
You can undo and redo actions with keys 'z' and 'y' respectively.

--EXPORTING--
If you have completed map design and want to export the map,
click the "export" button and name your map to whatever you like.
You can choose extra pieces of information to include in the file,
which will be saved as a txt file.
